Hello, my name is Daniel.

I'm a Swift developer, based in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm passionate about the Swift universe, design and user experience/development.

I am currently looking for an opportunity to enter the market. However, I am also the founder of [@Semgula](#), a platform that brings technology to restaurants and places them in the digital world.
